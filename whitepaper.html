        <!-- Executive Summary -->
        <section id="executive-summary">
            <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>•	Project Overview: Alpha is a memecoin based on Solana Blockchain. Our goal is to serve as a bridge between investors and entrepreneurs. We aim to ensure that people see memecoins not only as a source of entertainment but also as an investment tool. The current value is now $0.00002963 our target is reaching to $1
<p>
<p>
•	Key Highlights: Our most unique feature that sets us apart from other memecoins is our ability to offer people a real project. This tangible project will initially be realized through our "AlphaRooms" game. We aim to establish a connection between "game sales = increase in Alpha's price" among people. Unlike other memecoins, our low supply makes our price before $1 very attractive for investors.
 <p>
        </section>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
            <p> •	Background Information: Due to the fact that 99% of the recent memecoin projects have turned out to be Rug-Pulls, the trust and interest of crypto enthusiasts have significantly diminished. We are striving to rebuild trust among our investors and provide them with the necessary assurance of stable pricing.<p><p>
•	Mission and Vision: Our Alpha project aims to reach $1 in the initial stage. Until we reach the $1 target, we encourage all investors to hold onto their investments, and we conduct efforts to support HODLing. We particularly strive to achieve this through various events, including "Earn-burn," "Alpha Share," and "AlphaRooms."
 <p>
        </section>

        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <section id="problem-statement">
            <h2>3. Problem Statement</h2>
            <p> •	Identified Problems: The recent Rug-Pull incidents and the decrease in trust towards cryptocurrency<p>
<p>
•	Target Audience Needs: Alpha is still at the very beginning of its journey. We ask investors to be patient during this challenging journey. As a community, we hold only a small portion of the supply. Our goal is to acquire 80% of the supply and provide a reliable, stable space.
 <p>
        </section>

        <!-- Solution Overview -->
        <section id="solution-overview">
            <h2>4. Solution Overview</h2>
            <p> •	Proposed Solution: Our most effective solution to Rug-Pull incidents is our foundation in reality. Our community pool will be funded by Timur Özer's personal company. Typically, in Rug-Pull incidents, people don't risk their careers by opening a company. However, we are showcasing ourselves to our investors in a tangible sense.<p>
<p>
•	To steadily increase and maintain Alpha's price, we have developed a game called "AlphaRooms." With 50% of the revenue generated from this game, our aim is to purchase Alpha tokens from our liquidity pool on Raydium to boost the price. The address "AUSDwc35fxwkHCnC5n3yyaA7U79j4U18eMA93vy7M4hf" is the community pool address for Alpha Foundation. All transactions will be conducted from this address. With the Alpha tokens accumulated here, we will provide funding to entrepreneurial friends in need of investment, integrating them into our ecosystem and aiming for exponential growth.<p>
<p>
•	Let's move on to our activities. What is this Alpha Shares? Entrepreneurs with projects come to the Alpha Community and apply. After their applications are reviewed and they receive approval for investment, they start selling their projects. They explain what percentage of the profits they will be able to give as a share. For example: Project X guarantees a 10% share of the profits. They expect a $10,000 donation from the Alpha community for this 10% profit share guarantee. These donations are transferred to the wallets of entrepreneurs through Alpha. After starting to earn income from the project, the entrepreneur who received the investment sends 10% of the profits to the community pool. This profit share is distributed among the Alpha holders. This way, a secure bridge is established between Alpha investors and entrepreneurs. With this system, more entrepreneurs can be supported, and the reputation and usage of Alpha can be expanded.<p>
<p>
•	Another event we have is Earn-Burn: To participate in the event, everyone must send 1000 Alpha to the organizer's empty wallet. (As the value of Alpha increases, the minimum required Alpha value will decrease.) All wallets sending Alpha are recorded, and their names are written on a wheel. Then the wheel is spun, and the lucky winner is sent half of the collected Alpha. The remaining Alpha is sent to a burn wallet, reducing the total supply. <p>
<p>
•	Value Proposition: Projects like this, Alpha has become both a reliable investment vehicle and a memecoin with a steadily increasing price.

        <!-- Market Analysis -->
        <section id="market-analysis">
            <h2>5. Market Analysis</h2>
            <p> •	Industry Overview: At the time of writing, our trend is stable but low. Our market cap is $1,743, with a growth target of $58,832,816.<p>
<p>
•	Competitive Analysis: Among Solana memecoins, there is a competitor known as FamilyToken. FamilyToken's only claim to fame is the community it has built on Instagram. However, it is not a sustainable project. Soon, its developers will likely perform a rug-pull and disappear from the market because they do not offer anything tangible like we do. The only reason for their growth is the Instagram "day one" trend, unlike us who provide real value.
