    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Alpha is a memecoin on the Solana network aiming to bridge the gap between investors and those seeking investment opportunities. This dynamic and innovative project, managed by a community, aims to create a fair and transparent ecosystem.</p>
   <p>Launched on February 17th, the initial supply of 100 million Alpha tokens was reduced to 58 million by the creator. However, due to declining interest and uncertainties, the project was left unattended for a while, resulting in price declines. However, on March 6th, Alpha was revived by a group led by Timur Özer. During this period, effective advertising campaigns on Instagram and community-focused strategies reignited momentum for Alpha.</p>
   <p>One of the most significant features of Alpha is that its contracts start with the name ALPHA. This emphasizes the project's unique identity and its establishment as a reliable asset on the Solana network.</p>
   <p>Our main goal is to strengthen the bond between investors and potential investors. However, we adopt a community-focused approach and manage Alpha with a strong community. We believe in the value of each individual's contribution and strive to involve them in our project.</p>
   <p>Our current price performance excites us, and our goal is to raise Alpha to the $1 level. To achieve this goal, we work together with our community and expand our project with innovative methods such as "Earn-Burn" events every month.</p>
   <p>
Alpha is not just a cryptocurrency; it's also a community movement. Therefore, we invite everyone who joins our project to become part of the growing and strengthening Alpha family.

    <!-- Technical Details -->
    <section id="technical-details">
        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>Alpha, a memecoin on the Solana network, is integrated with Solana's fast and low-cost transaction blockchain technology. Leveraging advantages such as reliability and scalability, Alpha's technical infrastructure aims to provide users with a secure and efficient experience.</p>
    <p>The Alpha token is created in accordance with the SPL (Solana Program Library) token standard, similar to the ERC-20 standard on the Ethereum network. This allows Alpha tokens to be transferred quickly and cost-effectively on the Solana network.</p>
    <p>
The Earn-Burn event constitutes an important part of Alpha's economic model. In this event, participants join a draw by sending a certain amount of Alpha tokens, and when a winner is selected, half of the collected tokens are sent to the winning wallet while the other half is burned. This process aims to reduce the token supply, increase the token's value, and encourage community participation.
</p>
    <p>The initial supply of Alpha tokens was released into the market at 100 million and subsequently reduced to 58 million by the creator. The targeted supply was initially set at 50 million Alpha tokens, and the entire supply is currently in circulation. No further Alpha tokens will be minted, and minting has been closed, helping to stabilize the token's value and prevent inflation.</p>
    <p>Alpha's technical details are designed to ensure users can confidently participate in the project and are fully compliant with security standards on the Solana network.</p>
